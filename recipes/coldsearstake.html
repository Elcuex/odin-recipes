        <h3>How to make steaks at home easily without setting off your smoke alarm!</h3>
        Start steaks in a cold pan to greatly reduce smoke generated and mess.
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 boneless sirloin strip steaks (1.5 inches thick, room temperature)</li>
            <li>2 or 3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>salt (to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat steaks dry with paper towels and sprinkle both sides with pepper. Place steaks 1 inch apart in cold 12-inch nonstick skillet. Place skillet over high heat and cook steaks for 2 minutes. Flip steaks and cook on second side for 2 minutes. (Neither side of steaks will be browned at this point.)</li>
            <li>Flip steaks, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook, flipping steaks every 2 minutes, until browned and meat registers 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 4 to 10 minutes longer. (Steaks should be sizzling gently; if not, increase heat slightly. Reduce heat if skillet starts to smoke.)</li>
            <li>Add butter, rosemary and garlic to add flavour to the steak, flip and the steak to cover both sides and continue until garlic cloves become brown.</li>
            <li>Transfer steaks to carving board and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice steaks, season with coarse or flake sea salt to taste, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
